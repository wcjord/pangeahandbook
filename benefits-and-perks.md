### Sabbatical

In addition to annual PTO and holidays, every _three_ years employees may take a 30-day paid sabbatical. Give your team a heads-up preferably three months in advance so they can coordinate. If you’re terminated or resign from Pangea Chat with an unused sabbatical, Pangea Chat will pay you the monetary equivalent of those unused days only if your unused sabbatical was earned within the previous 12 months.

### Sick Time

We don’t offer a bank of sick days nor do we ask you to track your sick days. However if you’re unexpectedly away from work due to illness or injury for more than 5 consecutive work days, you’ll transition from sick time to Personal Leave. Pangea Chat does not pay out for unused sick time upon resignation or termination, since we have no sick time bank.

Your manager will check in with you if you’re consistently taking 2+ unplanned sick days per month. Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary measures. If you have a medical condition you know will take you away from work regularly, please work with your manager for accommodations.

### Personal Leave

Not yet.

### Day of Service

Pangea Chat also allows a Day of Service. You can take one day off every year to volunteer for a charitable or community organization of your choice. No need to use a vacation day or personal day, just let your team know you’ll be out. Pangea Chat does not pay out for unused Days of Service if you resign or are terminated from Pangea Chat.

### Disclaimer on Scheduling Time Off

The only time we ask you _not_ to schedule discretionary time-off is during a CODE. At Pangea Chat, we assign a CODE when urgent work needs to be done. We have three levels of criticality. A CODE RED is an emergency, a CODE YELLOW is less immediate but still critical, and a CODE LAUNCH is called when we’re in the final stages of launching a new product. If we’re in the midst of one of these and you can delay your vacation or sabbatical until after the code has ended, please do.

## Family Leave

Not yet.

## Bereavement Leave

Employees are granted time off with pay for a death in their immediate family.

Immediate family is defined as a spouse, child, parent, stepparent, grandparent or a sibling of the employee or the employees spouse. The standard amount of time given to employees for bereavement is three (3) paid days. If special circumstances require additional time, it should be taken as Paid Time Off.

For the death of a friend or relative not covered by this policy, an employee is generally granted up to four (4) paid hours of time away from work for the purpose of attending the funeral.
